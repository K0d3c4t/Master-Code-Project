The text editor allows you to change the text on a webpage as if it were a google doc. Click once to enable it and again to disable it. More scripts are to come when time is avalible.

## Settings

Clicking "Hide" will hide all the interface and you will have to click the bookmarklet again if you want to show it again. "Hide" will not Hide any scripts you have clicked on, only the interface. Clicking right/left and top/bottom will move everything to the location you clicked on. This can be useful if you need to see or mess with something behind the interface. Clicking Help will direct you to this page in a new window. More settings are to come when time is avalible.
